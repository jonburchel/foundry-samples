Azure AI Foundry Agent Sample - Tutorial 1: Modern Workplace Assistant

This sample demonstrates a complete business scenario combining:
- SharePoint integration for internal company knowledge
- Microsoft Learn MCP integration for external technical guidance  
- Intelligent orchestration of multiple data sources
- Robust error handling and graceful degradation

Educational Focus:
- Enterprise AI patterns with multiple data sources
- Real-world business scenarios that enterprises face daily
- Production-ready error handling and diagnostics
- Foundation for governance, evaluation, and monitoring (Tutorials 2-3)

Business Scenario:
An employee needs to implement Azure AD multi-factor authentication. They need:
1. Company security policy requirements (from SharePoint)
2. Technical implementation steps (from Microsoft Learn)
3. Combined guidance showing how policy requirements map to technical implementation
