## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Customize Trace Analysis

Add custom metrics to track:

```python
# In trace_debugging.py
custom_metrics = {
    "your_metric_name": calculate_custom_metric(traces),
    "business_kpi": calculate_business_kpi(traces)
}
```

### Customize Feedback Categories

Define organization-specific feedback categories:

```python
# In feedback_collection.py
feedback_categories = [
    "accuracy",
    "completeness",
    "tone",
    "latency",
    "your_custom_category"
]
```

### Customize Fine-Tuning Data

Filter conversations for fine-tuning:

```python
# In model_finetuning.py
def should_include_conversation(conv):
    return (
        conv["rating"] == "positive" and
        conv["token_count"] < 4000 and
        conv["your_custom_criteria"]
    )
```

### Customize Evaluation Insights

Add domain-specific insight rules:

```python
# In evaluation_insights.py
custom_insights = {
    "your_pattern": detect_your_pattern(evaluations),
    "your_trend": analyze_your_trend(evaluations)
}
```

### Customize Gateway Policies

Modify API Management policies:

```python
# In gateway_integration.py
custom_policies = {
    "rate_limit": "your_rate_limit",
    "transformation": "your_transformation",
    "security": "your_security_policy"
}
```

### Customize Monitoring Schedule

Adjust evaluation frequency:

```python
# In continuous_monitoring.py
monitoring_schedule = {
    "quality_checks": "0 */2 * * *",  # Every 2 hours
    "performance_checks": "0 0 * * *",  # Daily
    "cost_analysis": "0 0 * * 0"  # Weekly
}
```

## 📈 Best Practices

### Trace Collection

**Do:**
- ✅ Sample high-traffic agents to reduce costs
- ✅ Include business context in trace metadata
- ✅ Set up alerts for anomalies
- ✅ Retain traces for compliance requirements

**Don't:**
- ❌ Log sensitive PII in traces

- ❌ Ignore trace retention costs

### Feedback Collection

**Do:**
- ✅ Make feedback frictionless (1-click thumbs up/down)
- ✅ Follow up on negative feedback
- ✅ Use feedback to prioritize improvements
- ✅ Thank users for detailed feedback

**Don't:**
- ❌ Force users to provide feedback
- ❌ Ignore patterns in negative feedback
- ❌ Over-complicate feedback forms

### Fine-Tuning

**Do:**
- ✅ Start with high-quality examples (>4.0 rating)
- ✅ Balance dataset across topics
- ✅ Validate fine-tuned model before deployment
- ✅ A/B test against baseline
- ✅ Monitor for regression

**Don't:**
- ❌ Fine-tune with low-quality data
- ❌ Over-fit to recent examples
- ❌ Deploy without validation
- ❌ Fine-tune too frequently

### Cost Optimization

**Do:**
- ✅ Monitor costs daily
- ✅ Set budget alerts
- ✅ Use smaller models where appropriate
- ✅ Implement caching
- ✅ Optimize prompts for token efficiency

**Don't:**
- ❌ Sacrifice quality solely for cost
- ❌ Ignore optimization opportunities
- ❌ Over-provision resources

3. Verify network connectivity to Application Insights
4. Check sampling rate (may be too aggressive)
5. Review Application Insights quotas

### Issue: Low Feedback Response Rate

**Problem**: Users not providing feedback

**Solutions:**
1. Make feedback more prominent in UI
2. Simplify feedback mechanism (1-click)
3. Explain value of feedback to users
4. Consider incentives for feedback
5. Review feedback fatigue (too frequent prompts)

### Issue: Fine-Tuning Job Failures

**Problem**: Fine-tuning jobs fail or produce poor results

**Solutions:**
1. Validate training data format
2. Check data quality (ratings, completeness)
3. Ensure sufficient training examples (>50)
4. Balance dataset across topics
5. Review Azure OpenAI service limits
6. Check for data bias

### Issue: High Costs

**Problem**: Agent costs exceed budget

**Solutions:**
1. Review `cost_report.json` for breakdown
2. Implement recommended optimizations
3. Consider smaller models for simple queries
4. Enable caching for repeated questions
5. Optimize prompts to reduce tokens
6. Set up cost alerts to prevent overruns

### Issue: Gateway Throttling

**Problem**: API Management returns 429 (Too Many Requests)

**Solutions:**
1. Review rate limit policies
